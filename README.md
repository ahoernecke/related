Related
=======

Related is a Redis-backed high performance graph database.

Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

Related is meant to be a simple graph database that is fun, free and easy to
use. The intention is not to compete with industrial grade graph databases
like Neo4j, but rather to be a replacement for a relational database when your
data is better described as a graph. For example when building social
software. Related is meant to be web scale, but ultimately relies on the
ability of Redis to scale (using Redis cluster for example). Read more about
the philosophy behind Related in the
[Wiki](http://github.com/sutajio/related/wiki).

Setup
-----

Assuming you already have Redis installed:

    $ gem install related

Or add the gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
require 'related'
Related.redis = 'redis://.../'
```

If you are using Rails, add the above to an initializer. If Redis is running
on localhost and on the default port the second line is not needed.

Example usage
-------------

```ruby
node = Related::Node.create(:name => 'Example', :popularity => 2.3)
node.new?
node.popularity = 100
node.attributes
node.has_attribute?(:popularity)
node.read_attribute(:popularity)
node.write_attribute(:popularity, 50)
node.save
node.persisted?
node = Related::Node.find(node.id)
node.destroy
node.destroyed?

node1 = Related::Node.create
node2 = Related::Node.create
rel = Related::Relationship.create(:friends, node1, node2, :have_met => true)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id)
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id, :fields => [:name])
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id, :fields => [:name])
```

Nodes and relationships are both sub-classes of the same base class and both
behave similar to an ActiveRecord object and can store attributes etc.

To query the graph:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends)
node.incoming(:friends)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes
node.outgoing(:friends).limit(5)
node1.path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
node1.shortest_path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
```

To get the results from a query:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).to_a
node.outgoing(:friends).count (or .size, which is memoized)
```

You can also do set operations, like union, diff and intersect:

```ruby
node1.outgoing(:friends).union(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).diff(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).intersect(node2.outgoing(:friends))
```

Relationships are sorted based on when they were created, which means you can
paginate them:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(1)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(rel)
```

The second form paginates based on the id of the last relationship on the
previous page. Useful for cases where explicit page numbers are not
appropriate.

Pagination only works for relationships. If you want to access nodes directly
without going through the extra step of iterating through the relationship
objects you will only get random nodes. Thus you can use .limit (or .per_page)
like this to get a random selection of nodes:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes.limit(5)
```

Properties
----------

All Node and Relationship attributes are stored as strings in Redis, but you
can easily create your own subclass and define your own custom serialization
behavior. You can either just override the getter and setter methods for the
attribute you need to convert or you can use the `property` method to define
the semantics and let Related do the conversion for you.

```ruby
class Event < Related::Node
  property :attending_count, Integer
  property :popularity, Float
  property :start_date, DateTime
  property :location do |value|
    "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=#{value}"
  end
end
```

ActiveModel
-----------

Related supports ActiveModel and includes some basic functionality in both
nodes and relationships like validations, callbacks, JSON and XML
serialization and translation support. You can easily extend your own sub
classes with the custom ActiveModel functionality that you need.

```ruby
class Like < Related::Relationship
  validates_presence_of :how_much
  validates_numericality_of :how_much

  after_save :invalidate_cache

  def invalidate_cache
    ...
  end
end
```

Follower
--------

Related includes a helper module called Related::Follower that you can include
in your node sub-class to get basic Twitter-like follow functionality:

```ruby
require 'related/follower'

class User < Related::Node
  include Related::Follower
end

user1 = User.create
user2 = User.create

user1.follow!(user2)
user1.unfollow!(user2)
user2.followers
user1.following
user1.friends
user2.followed_by?(user1)
user1.following?(user2)
user2.followers_count
user1.following_count
```

The two nodes does not need to be of the same type. You can for example have
a User following a Page or whatever makes sense in your app.

Development
-----------

If you want to make your own changes to Related, first clone the repo and
run the tests:

    git clone git://github.com/sutajio/related.git
    cd related
    rake test

Remember to install the Redis server on your local machine.
