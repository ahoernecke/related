Related
=======

Related is a Redis-backed high performance graph database.

Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

Related is meant to be a simple graph database that is fun, free and easy to
use. The intention is not to compete with industrial grade graph databases
like Neo4j, but rather to be a replacement for a relational database when your
data is better described as a graph. For example when building social
software. Related is meant to be web scale, but ultimately relies on the
ability of Redis to scale (using Redis cluster for example). Read more about
the philosophy behind Related in the
[Wiki](http://github.com/sutajio/related/wiki).

Setup
-----

Assuming you already have Redis installed:

    $ gem install related

Or add the gem to your Gemfile.

```ruby
require 'related'
Related.redis = 'redis://.../'
```

If you are using Rails, add the above to an initializer. If Redis is running
on localhost and on the default port the second line is not needed.

Example usage
-------------

```ruby
node = Related::Node.create(:name => 'Example', :popularity => 2.3)
node.new?
node.popularity = 100
node.attributes
node.has_attribute?(:popularity)
node.read_attribute(:popularity)
node.write_attribute(:popularity, 50)
node.save
node.persisted?
node = Related::Node.find(node.id)
node.destroy
node.destroyed?

node1 = Related::Node.create
node2 = Related::Node.create
rel = Related::Relationship.create(:friends, node1, node2, :have_met => true)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id)
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id)

n = Related::Node.find(node1.id, :fields => [:name])
nn = Related::Node.find(node1.id, node2.id, :fields => [:name])
```

Nodes and relationships are both sub-classes of the same base class and both
behave similar to an ActiveRecord object and can store attributes etc.

To query the graph:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends)
node.incoming(:friends)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes
node.outgoing(:friends).limit(5)
node.outgoing(:friends).options(:fields => ..., :model => ...)
node1.path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
node1.shortest_path_to(node2).outgoing(:friends).depth(3)
```

To get the results from a query:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).to_a
node.outgoing(:friends).count (or .size, which is memoized)
```

You can also do set operations, like union, diff and intersect:

```ruby
node1.outgoing(:friends).union(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).diff(node2.outgoing(:friends))
node1.outgoing(:friends).intersect(node2.outgoing(:friends))
```

Relationships are sorted based on when they were created, which means you can
paginate them:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(1)
node.outgoing(:friends).relationships.per_page(100).page(rel)
```

The second form paginates based on the id of the last relationship on the
previous page. Useful for cases where explicit page numbers are not
appropriate.

Pagination only works for relationships. If you want to access nodes directly
without going through the extra step of iterating through the relationship
objects you will only get random nodes. Thus you can use .limit (or .per_page)
like this to get a random selection of nodes:

```ruby
node.outgoing(:friends).nodes.limit(5)
```

The root node
-------------

Related provides a special kind of node called the "root" node. It's always
accessible using the `Related.root` helper and you can create a relationship
between any node and the root node, which is useful if you want to easily
access a set of nodes without knowing the IDs of those nodes.

```ruby
Related::Relationship.create(:example, Related.root, node)
Related.root.outgoing(:example)
```

You can even add attributes to the root node if you want.

```ruby
Related.root.name = 'The root'
Related.root.save
```

Properties
----------

All Node and Relationship attributes are stored as strings in Redis, but you
can easily create your own subclass and define your own custom serialization
behavior. You can either just override the getter and setter methods for the
attribute you need to convert or you can use the `property` method to define
the semantics and let Related do the conversion for you.

```ruby
class Event < Related::Node
  property :title, String
  property :attending_count, Integer
  property :popularity, Float
  property :start_date, DateTime
  property :location do |value|
    "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=#{value}"
  end
end
```

An additional benefit of defining properties like this is that they get
included when you serialize the object to JSON or XML even when the attribute
hasn't been set.

```ruby
event = Event.create(:title => 'Party!', :location => 'Stockholm')
event.as_json # => {"title"=>"Party!","attending_count"=>nil,"popularity"=>nil,"start_date"=>nil,"location"=>"http://maps.google.com/maps?q=Stockholm"}
```

When querying the graph you may want the query to return the results as your
custom model class instead of as a Related::Node or Related::Relationship.
Related allows you to specify what model a specific node or relationship
should be instantiated as based on its attributes.

```ruby
Related::Node.find(...,
  :model => lambda {|attributes|
    attributes['start_date'] ? Event : Related::Node
  }
)

node.outgoing(:attending).options(
  :model => lambda {|attributes|
    attributes['start_date'] ? Event : Related::Node
  }
)
```

Weight
------

All relationships have an associated weight on its incoming and outgoing
links. By default the weight is set to the time when the relationship was
created. That makes the result from a query that fetches relationships always
sorted so that newer relationships appear first, which is nice. If you create
a custom Related::Relationship sub-class you can define how the weight is
generated for a relationship.

```ruby
class Comment < Related::Relationship
  property :created_at, Time
  property :points, Integer
  weight do |direction|
    if direction == :in
      self.created_at
    elsif direction == :out
      self.points
    end
  end
end
```

The weight is always an integer and is sorted in descending order.

The weight for the links get updated every time the relationship is saved. So
if you update the points for a Comment in the example above, the weight is
automatically updated. You can access the weight and rank (0 based position)
of a relationship like this:

```ruby
comment.weight(:out)
comment.rank(:in)
```

ActiveModel
-----------

Related supports ActiveModel and includes some basic functionality in both
nodes and relationships like validations, callbacks, JSON and XML
serialization and translation support. You can easily extend your own sub
classes with the custom ActiveModel functionality that you need.

```ruby
class Like < Related::Relationship
  validates_presence_of :how_much
  validates_numericality_of :how_much

  after_save :invalidate_cache

  def invalidate_cache
    ...
  end
end
```

Follower
--------

Related includes a helper module called Related::Follower that you can include
in your node sub-class to get basic Twitter-like follow functionality:

```ruby
require 'related/follower'

class User < Related::Node
  include Related::Follower
end

user1 = User.create
user2 = User.create

user1.follow!(user2)
user1.unfollow!(user2)
user2.followers
user1.following
user1.friends
user2.followed_by?(user1)
user1.following?(user2)
user2.followers_count
user1.following_count
```

The two nodes does not need to be of the same type. You can for example have
a User following a Page or whatever makes sense in your app.

Real-time Stream Processing
---------------------------

When working with graphs you often want to take the rich and interconnected
web of data and actually do something with it. Stream processing is a powerful
and flexible way to do that. It allows you to implement complex graph
algorithms in a scalable way that is also easy to understand and work with.

Stream processing in Related works by defining a data flow that new or
existing data will be streamed through. A data flow is triggered when a
Relationship is created, updated or deleted. You setup data flows for
different relationship types, so for example when a "friend" relationship
between two nodes is created or updated that relationship will be
automatically sent through the data flows you have defined for the "friend"
type.

A data flow can consist of one or more steps and can branch out in a tree.
You define the steps for a data flow using a simple Hash syntax.

```ruby
Related.data_flow :comment, Tokenize => { CountWords => { TotalSum => nil, MovingAverage => nil } }
```

In the example above a new comment will first sent to the Tokenize step that
will split the comment text into words. The list of words will then
automatically be sent to the CountWords step that will count the number of
unique words. That number will then be sent to both the TotalSum step that
adds the number to a global counter as well as the MovingAverage step that
will calculate and store a moving average. The nil indicates the end of the
data flow. You can define as many data flows for a relationship type as you
want.

A data flow step is simply a Ruby class that responds to the `process` message
and takes a single argument that holds the input data. Any data yielded from
the process method will be automatically sent to the next step in the data
flow. The only limitation is that the data sent between steps is a Hash and
only contains JSON serializable data. The first step in the data flow will
receive the Relationship object that triggered it as a Ruby hash with all of
its attributes.

```ruby
class Tokenize
  def self.process(data)
    data['text'].split(' ').each do |word|
      yield({ :word => word })
    end
  end
end
```

To actually run the data flows you have defined you need to start one or more
data flow workers. Related uses Resque which supplies persistent queues and
reliable workers. If you don't have Resque required in your application
Related will simply run the work flow directly in process instead which can
be useful when testing, but is not recommended for production.

To start a stream processor:

    $ QUEUE=related rake resque:work

You can start as many stream processors as you may need to scale
up.
